		<h2>Bio</h2>
		<p>I cut my very first project when I was sixteen (a no-budget zombie film, of course). Amazingly, it was <strong>not</strong> the worst thing I have done since then.</p>
		<p>The good news is that I have also gone on to do much better things too. I have worked on projects that have made rounds at festivals, and managed to edit for clients like Bacardi and Acuvue. I suppose my perfectionism and ridiculous dedication to sacrificing sleep had something to do with it.</p>
		<p>I like to do things well, so hit me up if you need that for your project. If you’re here by mistake, I’m down to have a drink but you’re paying for the first round.</p>
